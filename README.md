# Portfolio
Deployed version of my portfolio:  https://isabellelidberg.netlify.com/ (WIP)

On this project, I created a portfolio with all of my previous projects during CraftAcademy bootcamp.

## Synopsis

This portfolio is built with the Middleman-framework and with bootstrap as a css-framework.
The programming language used in this projects is HAML and ruby.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project was to create a website where I can put all of my projects together, while using different types of languages like JavaScript, css, HTML, HAML and jQuery. For me this was the perfect practice to learn how to combine different types of languages together and how to actually make it work.

## How does it work?

I deployed my portfolio to GitHub pages, so just click on this link and feel free to guide yourself around to see what I've created this week..
